# RUN THE APP 


## Model

A convolutional neural network model that runs on RGB images and predicts human joint locations of a single person. The model is designed to be run in the browser using Tensorflow.js or on devices using TF Lite in real-time, targeting movement/fitness activities. This variant: MoveNet.SinglePose.Lightning is a lower capacity model (compared to MoveNet.SinglePose.Thunder) that can run >50FPS on most modern laptops while achieving good performance.

## Requirements

* Android Studio 3.2 (installed on a Linux, Mac or Windows machine)
* Android device in developer mode with USB debugging enabled
* USB cable (to connect Android device to your computer)

## Build and run

* Step 1. Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/naman-jain-44/VitualGymAndYoga.git
```
* Step 2. Open Android Studio and from there choose 'Open an Existing Project'

* Step 3. Build the Android Studio project
```
Select Build -> Make Project and check that the project builds successfully. You will need Android SDK configured in the settings. You'll need at least SDK version 23. The build.gradle file will prompt you to download any missing libraries.
```
* Step 4. Install and Run the app
```
Connect the Android device to the computer and be sure to approve any ADB permission prompts that appear on your phone. Select Run -> Run app. Select the deployment target in the connected devices to the device on which the app will be installed. This will install the app on the device.
```
To test the app, open the app called ```VirtualGymAndYoga``` on your device. When you run the app the first time, the app will request permission to access the camera. Re-installing the app may require you to uninstall the previous installations.


## That's it!
